# CodeCumbria - Source Control Presentation and Workshop (Feb 27th 2013)

## Overview

Rather than a straight talk, which may necessarily skip over stuff due time constraints, or just end up being to dry and boring the pants off everyone (including me - I'm arguably not the best presenter, but here goes....) I wanted to do something different.

There had been various discussions between folks about how to liven up CodeCumbria meetings, and more importantly get folks involved in a way that may not always be possible with just a talk. One recurring idea was that of a workshop style format, that could be preceeded by a short talk to introduce the topic.

I had been toying with the idea of doing a talk on Source Control for awhile, but had been strugling on finding a way to try and make it more interesting. It was during a discussion with Steve at one of the short lived Open Source Cumbria meetings, that the idea for using the talk/workshop format was raised (by Steve). I liked the idea, and thought on it for awhile, and well, here is the result.

As audience participation is desired, there are a few pre-requisites. Namely a laptop with Git installed.

I only ask for Git, as it's what I use, and what I'm more familiar with and therefore easier to base a workshop on. I don't hold to putting any quasi-religious bent on whatever tools you use.

Hopefully you'll get the base concepts and will be able to put them to use with whatever source control system you may choose to use. If indeed, you choose to use one at all, although I would recommend them to the death.

By way of an example, the presentation source files are hosted in this Github repository, and we will be using them for the workshop.
