Source Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  What is it?
  ~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  * Version / Revision / Source control
  * Track changes to files in a project
  * Works best on text files
    * source code
    * html / css / js
    * plain text
  * Not so good on binary files
    * images
    * document / pdf
    
  Why do I need it?
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  * Reports, Class Papers
    * seperate, named files
    * shared folder
  * Programming / Web projects
    * seperate, named files unmangaeable
    * need to track many changes, potentially by a number of people 

  Types
  ~~~~~
  
  * Genrally come in one or two forms
  * Centralised
    * RCS - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System
    * CVS - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System
    * Subversion (SVN) - http://subversion.apache.org/
  * Distributed
    * Bazaar - http://bazaar.canonical.com/
    * Mercurial - http://mercurial.selenic.com/
    * Git - http://git-scm.com/
    
  Centralised vs Distributed
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  * Solve different problems, may as well compare apples to oranges
  * Centralised
    * 'One True Source' which is blessed
    * Developers work on a local copy
    * Changes become blessed once 'pushed' up and merged
  * Distributed
    * No-one repository is blessed
    * In practice, one repository usually has ultimate trust. But this is defined by the workflow process used, not the version control software
  * The real choice is purely organisational or workflow based
    * Centralised - only ever, one internal team
    * Destributed - Geographically seperated developers
    
  Workshop
  ~~~~~~~~
  
  * Basic principles are similar between different systems
  * Using Git as an example
    * Tried CVS, and SVN
    * Is what I'm most familiar with as I use it on a day to day basis
  * Using repository containing files for presentation
  * Available on Github
    * [Github URL to go here]
